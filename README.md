# Redball-Raylib-c
A simple RedBall game developed with C and Raylib.

# 🔴 RedBall - 2D Platformer Game

A classic 3-level platformer game built from scratch using **C** and **Raylib**.

This project was developed to understand low-level game programming concepts, memory management, and game physics without relying on heavy game engines.

## 🚀 Features & Technical Highlights

* **Engine:** Built with pure **C** and **Raylib** library.
* **Physics:** Custom-written physics engine handling gravity and velocity.
* **Collision:** Implemented **AABB (Axis-Aligned Bounding Box)** collision detection.
* **Architecture:** Game states (Menu, Gameplay, Game Over) managed via **Finite State Machine (FSM)**.
* **Memory:** Manual memory management (malloc/free) for dynamic entity loading.
* **Audio:** Original sound effects produced with **GarageBand**.

## 🎮 How to Play

You don't need to compile the code to play!
1.  Go to the Releses page.
2.  Download the latest `.zip` file.
